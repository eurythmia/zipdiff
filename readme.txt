ZipDiff-ng is a fork of ZipDiff with the intention of modernizing
and simplifying the tool.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ZipDiff compares two zip files and creates a list of differences. Plain text, .xml, .html and even a .zip file are supported as output formats.

ZipDiff can be executed as command line tool or ant task.
